## Usage

### Server

The server-side of Fullness is responsible for managing data and serving APIs to the client. To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in the `server` directory:

   ```shell
   cd server
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

The server will start on port 5000 by default. You can access the server's APIs via `http://localhost:5000`.

### Client

The client-side of Fullness is built using React and provides the user interface for the application. To run the client, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in the `client` directory:

   ```shell
   cd client
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

The client will start on port 3000 by default. You can access the application in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
